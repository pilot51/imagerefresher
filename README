ImageRefresher (needs a better name) is an IP camera viewer that streams a rapidly updated JPG image and audio.

Currently, it has only been designed and tested to support KEEBOX IPC1000W and is unlikely to work with other brands.

This project was intended for my own use and as such I do not intend to provide support outside of my own needs. It is open source just in case anyone else might find it useful.
